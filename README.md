# wordle_text_based
A simple text-based version of Wordle

TO-DOs (in priority order):

#  TO-DO 4 ... error check to only accept 5 letter words (much later TO-DO will be checking the guesses are acceptable words)
#  TO-DO 1 ... print used letters for each attempt, so player can see which letters are / (right letter in right place), + (right letter but wrong place), and x (wrong letter; not in word)
